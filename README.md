# Chess for Kids

## Game Description

Chess is a two player board game in which each player begins with two armies of 16 pieces and the goal is to checkmate the opponent’s King. It can be played in player vs player mode or play against the computer.

## User Stories

This particular game is tailored to teach kids how to learn to play chess and include colorful graphics as well as animations. The game will start with a short introduction to the game and each type of piece on the board (what it is called and how it moves). During play when a piece on the board is clicked the user will be able to see all possible valid moves. If the user attempts to move the piece onto a square that is not highlighted the game will prompt an invalid move message. When a King is in “check” the king piece will be highlighted red and the user will be warned.
